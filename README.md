## WINE INVESTOR ANALYSIS OBJECTIVE:  
Our client approached our data analysis firm wanting to invest in a winery.  They are asking us to identify which countries around the world should they consider to invest in a vineyard which produces the top scoring wines and which varietals tend to be the most popular.  They want us to analyze the highest scored wines and which countries produce those wines.  

From a top (10) result they have further asked us to narrow that selection down to the top (3) countries and corresponding top (3) varietals for investment consideration as well as average price per bottle for economic analysis at a later date.
